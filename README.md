## Journal Application

This is my first Spring boot project that I am pushing to my personal GitHub.  
It's currently in the early stages of development.  

### Upcoming Enhancements  
In the upcoming commits, I plan to integrate:  
- **Docker** for containerization  
- **Kubernetes** for orchestration  
- **Kafka** for event streaming  
- **Redis** for caching
- **crons jobs** for job scheduling
- **jwt** for **authentication** and **authorization**  
- **integrated with external api**
- **OAuth 2.0* to support one login using Sign on with google
  
Stay tuned for updates! ðŸš€
